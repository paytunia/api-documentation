The Paymium FIX API allows developers to subscribe to real-time market updates using the Financial Information eXchange protocol in its 4.4 version. This API is currently in beta-testing phase.

Do not hesitate to contact the support for any issues or suggestions. We're also available on IRC at Freenode on the #paymium channel, ring davout for assistance.

## Currently supported
 - Subscription to the real-time depth

## On the roadmap
 - Ability to place orders and receive execution reports

# Using the FIX API

## Obtaining access
Our FIX acceptor is available at fix.paymium.com on port 8359.

## Managing the session
Once connected, your client is expected to issue a `Logon` message containing `PAYMIUM` as the `TARGET_COMP_ID`, a non-blank `Username` (553) field. Encryption is not supported, the `EncryptMethod` (98) field must be set to `0`.

The acceptor will then reply with a `Logon` message. From there on, `Heartbeat` messages are expected at regular intervals.

The acceptor will correctly handle `TestRequest` messages by replying with a matching `Heartbeat`. It will also handle a `ResendRequest` by resending the requested message range.

## Obtaining market data

Clients may issue a `MarketDataRequest` to subscribe to the depth feed. Typically it will allow a client to receive a snapshot of the current state of the order book once, followed by real-time incremental updates whenever the data changes. See the example session.


# Example FIX session
This session shows the message exchange between a client and the Paymium acceptor for the purpose of receiving market data updates.

Messages sent by the client are indicated by a `>>>` while received messages are prepended with a `<<<`. Separator bytes are replaces with pipe characters for clarity.
