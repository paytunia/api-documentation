**NEW: Our sandbox environment is now available, visit [sandbox.paymium.com](https://sandbox.paymium.com) (you may have to add a security exception for the SSL certificate to validate).**

The Paymium API allows developers to extend the capabilities of the Paymium platform, from reading the latest ticker to automating trades with bots.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Your API client must support [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) in order to not receive certificate name mismatch warnings.

Is is possible to, among other things:

* Access public data (ticker, asks, bids, trades, etc...)
* Authenticate users with their permission using OAuth2 *
* Access authenticated user balances, trades, and other data *
* Automate trading *

_* Authenticating users is only available to developers that have a fully verified and approved Paymium account. On the other hand, public data is available to everyone_

## General information

### Formats and required HTTP request headers

The API will only answer with JSON or empty responses. It expects parameters to be passed in JSON with the correct `Content-Type: application/json` being set.

## Localization

The relevant results and error messages will be localized to the language associated to the user, currently English and French are supported.

## Datetime formats

Datetime values will be returned as regular JSON format and Unix timestamps, the timestamps are suffixed with `_int`.

## Error handling

Whenever an error is encountered, the answer to a JSON API call will have:

 * An HTTP 422 status (Unprocessable entity) or HTTP 400 (Bad request)
 * A JSON array of localized error messages in the `errors` attribute of the response body

##### Example:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    "Operations account operations amount is greater than your available balance (1781.96 EUR)"
    "Amount can't be greater than your limit (1781.96 EUR)"
  ]
}
```

## Successful calls

If the API call was successful, the platform will answer with:

 * An HTTP 200 status (OK) or HTTP 201 (Created),
 * A JSON representation of the entity being created or updated if relevant

### Rate-limiting

API calls are rate-limited by IP to 86400 calls per day (one per second on average). Information about the status of the limit can be found in the `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` HTTP headers.

**Example response with rate-limit headers**

    HTTP/1.1 200  
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    X-Ratelimit-Limit: 5000
    X-Ratelimit-Remaining: 4982

## Authentication

### Permissions

Before you request authorization to access a user's account, you must decide which permissions, or scopes you would like to access.

The following scopes are available:

| name           | description                                                                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| basic          | Read account number, language, and balances (default)                                     |
| activity       | Read trade orders, deposits, withdrawals, and other operations                            |
| trade          | Create and cancel trade orders                                                            |
| withdraw       | Request EUR and BTC withdrawals (requires email confirmation from users upon withdrawing) |
| deposit        | List bitcoin deposit addresses and create a new one if needed                             |
| merchant       | Create and manage an account's invoices                                                   |

### Token authentication

This authentication mechanism is the recommended method if you need to access your own account data and is also referred to as **HMAC authentication**, if you need to access other users accounts on their behalf you'll need to use the OAuth2 authentication method.

##### Generating a token

For this authentication method you need to generate a token/secret pair that you will use to make requests against our API. In order to do so visit the "API tokens" menu in your account profile and click on "Create token". You will be presented with the following screen that will enable you to select the desired access permissions for this token. For security reasons you will need to confirm your access credentials.

![Create an API token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Paymium/api-documentation/master/create-api-token.png)

Once your token is created you'll be presented **once** with the matching secret key, this secret key is only displayed once, you need to record it carefully. If the secret key is lost the token becomes useless.

##### Making requests

Once you have an API token and its matching secret key you can use them to make requests against our API. In order to do so you must include three HTTP headers that will authenticate your request.

```bash
$ curl "https://paymium.com/api/v1/user"               \
     --header "Api-Key: <YOUR API TOKEN>"              \
     --header "Api-Signature: <THE REQUEST SIGNATURE>" \
     --header "Api-Nonce: <AN UPDATED NONCE>"          \
```

 * The **API key** is the token that is displayed when listing your currently active tokens,
 * The **API signature** is a HMAC-SHA256 hash of the nonce concatenated with the full URL and body of the HTTP request, encoded using your API secret key,
 * The **nonce** is a positive integer number that must increase with every request you make

### OAuth2 authentication

This authentication mechanism is best suited to cases where a developer publishes an app that requires access its users Paymium accounts.

Many programming languages already have libraries to develop clients that connect to OAuth2 APIs, hence the following steps may not be necessary. For instance, if you are a Ruby developer, you can use [this example to get started](#ruby-example).

The process can be summarized as follows:

1. Send the user to your application's authorization URL
2. Receive the authorization code if the user accepted the request
3. Get an access token and a refresh token from the authorization code
4. Refresh the access token when needed

##### Requesting user authorization

To get user's permission to use his/her account, you must send him/her to your application's redirect URI. You can see this URI by visiting your application's page: [https://paymium.com/page/developers/apps](https://paymium.com/page/developers/apps).

By default, the `basic` scope will be requested.

If your application requires specific access scopes, you must append a scope GET parameter to the authorization URI:

    https://paymium.com/...&scope=basic+activity+trade

The user will then be prompted to authorize your application with the specified scopes.

##### Receiving the authorization code

If you specified the test redirection URI `https://paymium.com/page/oauth/test`, the user will be presented the autorization code upon accepting your request which can be used by the application to fetch access tokens.

Otherwise the code or error will be sent to the redirection URI so that your application can retrieve it (in this case `https://example.com/callback`):

    https://example.com/callback?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE

Or if the request was denied by the user:

    https://example.com/callback?error=access_denied&error_description=The+resource+owner+or+authorization+server+denied+the+request.

The authorization code is valid 5 minutes.

##### Fetching an access token and a refresh token

Once your application received the authorization code, it can request an access token and a refresh token:

```bash
$ curl "https://paymium.com/api/oauth/token"                    \
    -d "client_id=APPLICATION_KEY"                              \
    -d "client_secret=APPLICATION_SECRET"                       \
    -d "grant_type=authorization_code"                          \
    -d "redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI"                              \
    -d "code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE"
```

```json
{
  "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 1800,
  "refresh_token": "REFRESH_TOKEN",
  "scope": "basic"
}
```

An access token can be used to authorize user requests for the approved scopes and is valid 30 minutes.

##### Refreshing the access token

Since an access token is only valid 30 minutes, your application may need to fetch a new access token using the refresh token:

```bash
$ curl "https://paymium.com/api/oauth/token"                    \
    -d "client_id=APPLICATION_KEY"                              \
    -d "client_secret=APPLICATION_SECRET"                       \
    -d "grant_type=refresh_token"                               \
    -d "redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI"                              \
    -d "refresh_token=REFRESH_TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "access_token": "NEW_ACCESS_TOKEN",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 1800,
  "refresh_token": "NEW_REFRESH_TOKEN",
  "scope": "basic"
}
```

After refreshing the access token, the previous tokens (access and refresh) are no longer valid.

### Bitcoin-Charts endpoints

Two API endpoints dedicated to [Bitcoin-Charts](http://bitcoincharts.com) are publicly accessible, they are accessible at:

 * `https://paymium.com/api/v1/bitcoin_charts/eur/trades`, and
 * `https://paymium.com/api/v1/bitcoin_charts/eur/depth`

The data they return is formatted according to the [Bitcoin Charts exchange API specification](http://bitcoincharts.com/about/exchanges/).

### WebSocket

A [socket.io](http://socket.io) endpoint is available to receive public data. This allows you to receive new data without having to poll the server.

The socket.io socket will emit a `stream` event when new data is available. The received JSON data contains one or more of the properties listed below, depending on what was updated.

#### Socket.io configuration

Socket.io must connect to `https://paymium.com/public` and the `resource` option must be set to `ws/socket.io`.

#### Stream properties

| name            | description                                                                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ticker          | object containing updated ticker data                                         |
| trades          | array of newly executed trades                                                |
| bids            | array of new or updated bids (a bid is considered gone if amount is null)     |
| asks            | array of new or updated asks (an ask is considered gone if amount is null)    |

#### Node.js example

Assuming you have node.js installed, you can install the socket.io client library by running `npm install socket.io-client@0.9`.

The code below shows how to connect to the Paymium socket, and outputs any received data to the console.

The example is available in the `examples/public_socket.js` directory of this repository.

```javascript
  var io = require('socket.io-client');

  socket = io.connect('https://paymium.com/public', {
    resource: 'ws/socket.io'
  });

  console.log('CONNECTING');

  socket.on('connect', function() {
    console.log('CONNECTED');
    console.log('WAITING FOR DATA...');
  });

  socket.on('disconnect', function() {
    console.log('DISCONNECTED');
  });

  socket.on('stream', function(data) {
    console.log('GOT DATA:');
    console.log(data);
  });

```

### FIX streaming API

The FIX API is documented separately: [documentation](https://github.com/Paymium/api-documentation/blob/master/FIX-4.4.md).


## User data

Before you can access your own data or other users data, you must register an application on Paymium:

1. Verify your account and log in
2. Visit [https://paymium.com/page/developers/apps](https://paymium.com/page/developers/apps)
3. Create an application (set redirect URI to `https://paymium.com/page/oauth/test` when testing)

### User info

## Merchant API

The Merchant API enables merchants to securely sell goods and services and get paid in Bitcoin. The API makes it possible for the merchant to completely eliminate the risk of market fluctuations when requesting to receive fiat currency in their account. It is also possible to keep a part of the payment in Bitcoin without having it converted at a guaranteed rate.

The API allows developers to integrate Bitcoin payments very tightly into their platforms, pre-packaged plugins are also available for a growing list of popular e-commerce frameworks.

For merchants that have very simple needs payment buttons are also available, these buttons remove the integration completely by allowing merchants to simply include a code snippet on a static HTML page, or on a blog to receive fixed-amount payments.

### Payment creation

##### Authentication

_The "merchant token" authentication mechanism has been removed please use an [API token](#token-authentication) or an [OAuth2 token](#oauth2-authentication) instead with the "merchant" scope._

##### Description

A payment is created by a merchant platform when the customer chooses Bitcoin as his desired checkout option.

The merchant platform can then :
* display the payment Bitcoin address on his own web interface,
* include the Paymium web interface url in an iframe in order to display a payment pop-up as an overlay,
* redirect the buyer to the payement's URL (see below), in this case the payment is displayed on a separate screen

To display the payment request to the user, the `https://paymium.com/invoice/{UUID}` can be used, this is used by the e-commerce framework plugins.

Once the payment request is displayed, the customer has 15 minutes to send the appropriate amount.

Paymium notifies the merchant of the completion of his payment via the associated callback (for which an URL may be provided when creating the payment request), once one Bitcoin confirmation for the payment is received the funds are credited to the merchant's account, a callback notification is then made.

##### Response

See [Payment properties](#returned-json-object-properties)

### Payment callbacks

When a payment is created or updated, and if a callback URL was provided, a notification is made.

When the notification is made a `POST` request is made to the callback URL, it contains the JSON representation of the payment (see the [payment properties](#get-payment-information)).

The merchant should ensure the callback is legitimate by requesting confirmation from the Paymium API for the invoice data.

**Note :** The callback notifications are not guaranteed to be unique, it must have idempotent results on the merchant side if the payment has not actually changed.

### Ruby example

This example uses the OAuth2 Ruby gem.

The [`AutoRefreshToken`](https://gist.github.com/davout/edb4db0315dc417fa78d) class encapsulates this logic, it is available as a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/davout/edb4db0315dc417fa78d).

```ruby
require 'oauth2'

client = OAuth2::Client.new('6fcf1c32f6e14cd773a7a6640832bdbf83a5b2b8d4382e839c6aff83a8f1bb3b', '55554ecad5627f0465034c4a116e59a38d9c3ab272487a18404078ccc0b64798', site: 'https://paymium.com', authorize_url: '/api/oauth/authorize', token_url: '/api/oauth/token')

client.auth_code.authorize_url(redirect_uri: 'https://paymium.com/page/oauth/test', scope: 'basic activity trade withdraw')

# Visit this URL in your browser, approve the request and copy the authorization code

authorization_code = '9b55e27c840f59d927284fdc438ee3d8fac94b00e24d331162ddff76c1a6bcc0'

token = client.auth_code.get_token(authorization_code, redirect_uri: 'https://paymium.com/page/oauth/test')

token.get('/api/v1/user').body
