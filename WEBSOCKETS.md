## Private messages

### Channel subscribtion

These messages are broadcast on specific channels, and not publicly. Knowledge of the channel identifier is required in order to subscribe to these messages.

There are two types of channels:
 * User channels: they broadcast messages relevant to a particular user
 * Payment channels: they broadcast messages relevant to a specific payment

Clients will typically subscribe to the relevant user channel if authenticated, and to every payment-specific channel of interest to them.

The user channel ID is returned in the "channel" key in response to sign-in POSTs or user GETs. The payment channel ID is the payment's UUID, as returned by the REST API calls.

All the messages in the "Private messages" section are sent on user channels, with the exception of payment updates, which are sent on the specific payment's channel.

## Connection examples

### Public socket

```javascript
var io = require('socket.io-client');

var socket = io.connect('paymium.com/public', {
  path: '/ws/socket.io'
});

console.log('CONNECTING');

socket.on('connect', function() {
  console.log('CONNECTED');
  console.log('WAITING FOR DATA...');
});

socket.on('disconnect', function() {
  console.log('DISCONNECTED');
});

socket.on('stream', function(data) {
  console.log('GOT DATA:');
  console.log(data);
});
```

### User socket

```javascript
var io = require('socket.io-client');

var socket = io.connect('paymium.com/user', {
  path: '/ws/socket.io'
});

console.log('CONNECTING');

socket.on('connect', function() {
  console.log('CONNECTED');
  console.log('WAITING FOR DATA...');
});

// Replace USER_CHANNEL_ID with the channel id of the user
socket.emit('channel', 'USER_CHANNEL_ID');

socket.on('disconnect', function() {
  console.log('DISCONNECTED');
});

socket.on('stream', function(data) {
  console.log('GOT DATA:');
  console.log(data);
});
```
